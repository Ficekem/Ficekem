### Hi there, my name is Laszlo ðŸ‘‹

# About me
I am a self taught programmer with a strong desire to learn and work hard to achieve my goals. Programming is a big passion of mine and has continuously peeked my interest since learning my first "Hello World" in the Pascal programming language. Since I had the pleasure to dive into many programming languages including good old plain BASIC and many variants of it, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Lua, C, C++, PHP, Swift, Haxe. The most recent addition to this list is the Python programming language.
