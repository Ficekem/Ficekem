### Hi there 👋

# About
My name is Laszlo and I am a self taught programmer.
Programming is a big passion of mine and has continuously peeked my interest since learning my first "Hello World".
Currently I am enrolled in a Data Science Skills Bootcamp where I learn Python for science, Data Analysing, Data Visualisation, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Pandas, Seaborn, spAcy, Numpy and as part of the Skills Bootcamp I am looking for my first entry level position as a Data Engineer, Data Analyst, Software Developer or Web developer.
In my spare time I also enjoy to explore game development and experiment with different game engines, frameworks features and techniques.
